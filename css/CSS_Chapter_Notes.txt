The idea is that every element on the page is contained inside of another element, which in turn can contain other elementsâ€”like Russian nesting dolls.

This hierarchical tag structure is known as the Document Object Model, or DOM for short. Each new level in the DOM is a child of the level above it.

In CSS, styling rules flow down from parents to children unless another style interrupts and takes priority.

CSS statements are made up of selectors, properties and values...

selector {
	property: value;
}

div {
	border: 1px solid black;
}


Traditionally, we organize css properties alphabetically


div{
	border: 1px solid black;
	margin: auto;	
	text-align: center;
	text-decoration: underline;
}
